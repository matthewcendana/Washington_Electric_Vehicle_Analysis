# Washington Electric Vehicle Analysis
A Python Jupyter Notebook that explores the electric vehicle population registered in Washington State using data sourced from the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). 

## What’s Inside
Data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure accuracy.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) including descriptive statistics, visualizations (e.g. distributions, trends over time, geographic breakdown).

Insights into make/model popularity, BEV vs. PHEV adoption, electric range, price, and county-wise distribution.

Well-commented Python code using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## How to Use It
Open the notebook (electric-vehicle-population-in-washington-analysis.ipynb) in Jupyter, Colab, or your preferred environment.

Run through the cells sequentially—dependencies are imported at the top.

Review visual outputs and findings directly inline.

## Why It Matters
This notebook provides a streamlined, interactive analysis pipeline that helps you understand EV adoption trends across Washington, backed by real DOL data.
